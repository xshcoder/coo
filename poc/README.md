# üïäÔ∏è Coo - Simplified Twitter Application (Single Service Layer with Microservices Proof Of Concept)

## 1. Introduction

**Coo** is a simplified social media platform inspired by Twitter. In this Proof of Concept (PoC), we use a **single service layer** with **microservices**. Each feature of the application is handled by its own microservice, such as user management, coo management, replies, likes, follows, and search functionalities. 

The system allows users to:
- Register a **User**
- Post a **Coo** (similar to a tweet)
- **Reply** to a **Coo**
- **Like** a **Coo**
- **Follow** other users
- **Search** for users or coos based on specific criteria
- Display a timeline of following **User**s' **Coo**s, replies to user's own **Coo**s, and replies to following **User**s' **Coo**s.

## 2 Service Architecture

The PoC is structured into the following microservices:

- **User Service** ‚Äì Handles user operations such as registration, updates, and deletion.
- **Coo Service** ‚Äì Manages coo creation, retrieval, and updates.
- **Reply Service** ‚Äì Handles replies to coos and retrieves replies for a specific coo.
- **Like Service** ‚Äì Manages likes and unlikes on coos.
- **Follow Service** ‚Äì Manages follow/unfollow functionality and retrieving followers/following lists.
- **Search Service** ‚Äì Allows users to search for users by handle/name or coos by content.
- **Personalize Service** ‚Äì Provide personalized content based on user preferences.
- **Statistics Service** ‚Äì Provides statistics about replies, likes and views counts of coo or reply
